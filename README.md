# WinterCMS-based project

## Install

### WinterCMS

Installing Winter via Composer is easy. You can use the `create-project` command through Composer to quickly set up a new Winter installation.

```bash
composer create-project wintercms/winter <your installation directory>

# Example:
#   composer create-project wintercms/winter mywinter
```

If you wish to install a specific version of Winter, you can also specify the version.

```bash
composer create-project wintercms/winter <your installation directory> "<version>"

# Example:
#   composer create-project wintercms/winter mywinter "1.0.474"
```
